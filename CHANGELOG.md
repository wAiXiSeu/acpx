## Unreleased

### Changes

- Conformance/ACP: add a data-driven ACP core v1 conformance suite with CI smoke coverage, nightly coverage, and a hardened runner that reports startup failures cleanly and scopes filesystem checks to the session cwd. (#130) Thanks @lynnzc.
- CLI/prompts: add `--prompt-retries` to retry transient prompt failures with exponential backoff while preserving strict JSON behavior and avoiding replay after prompt side effects. (#142) Thanks @lupuletic and @dutifulbob.
- Output: add `--suppress-reads` to mask raw file-read bodies in text and JSON output while keeping normal tool activity visible. (#136) Thanks @hayatosc.
- Agents/droid: add `factory-droid` and `factorydroid` aliases for the built-in Factory Droid adapter and sync the built-in docs. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Flows/workflows: add an initial `flow run` command, an `acpx/flows` runtime surface, and file-backed flow run state under `~/.acpx/flows/runs` for user-authored workflow modules. Thanks @osolmaz.
- Flows/workspaces: let `acp` nodes bind to an explicit per-step cwd, add a native isolated-workspace example, and default active flow steps to a 15 minute timeout unless overridden. Thanks @osolmaz.
- Flows/replay: store flow runs as trace bundles with `manifest.json`, `flow.json`, `trace.ndjson`, projections, bundled session replay data, and per-attempt ACP/action receipts for later inspection. Thanks @osolmaz.
- Flows/replay viewer: add a React Flow-based replay viewer example that replays saved run bundles and shows the bundled ACP session beside the graph. Thanks @osolmaz.
- Flows/replay viewer: keep recent runs and the active recent-run view live over a WebSocket snapshot/patch transport so in-progress runs update without manual refresh while rewind stays available.
- Flows/permissions: let flows declare explicit required permission modes, fail fast when a flow requires an explicit `--approve-all` grant, and preserve the granted mode through persistent ACP queue-owner paths. Thanks @osolmaz.
- Agents/qoder: add built-in Qoder CLI ACP support via `qoder -> qodercli --acp` and document Qoder-specific auth notes.
- Agents/qoder: forward `--allowed-tools` and `--max-turns` session options into Qoder CLI startup flags, including persisted session reuse, without requiring a raw `--agent` override.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Agents/kiro: use `kiro-cli-chat acp` for the built-in Kiro adapter command to avoid orphan child processes. (#129) Thanks @vokako.
- Agents/cursor: recognize Cursor's `Session \"...\" not found` `session/load` error format so reconnects fall back to `session/new` instead of failing. (#162) Thanks @log-li.
- Output/thinking: preserve line breaks in text-mode `[thinking]` output instead of flattening multi-line thought chunks into one line. (#144) Thanks @Huarong.
- Sessions/load: fall back to a fresh ACP session when adapters reject `session/load` with JSON-RPC `-32601` or `-32602`, so persistent session reconnects do not crash on partial load support. (#174) Thanks @Bortlesboat.
- Flows/runtime: finalize interrupted `flow run` bundles as failed instead of leaving them stuck at `running` when the process receives `SIGHUP`, `SIGINT`, or `SIGTERM`.
- Client/auth: cache derived auth env key lists per auth method to avoid repeated allocations during credential lookup. (#167) Thanks @Yuan-ManX.

## 2026.3.12 (v0.3.0)

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: add Factory Droid and iFlow as built-in ACP agents and document their built-in commands. (#112, #109) Thanks @ironerumi and @gandli.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Codex/session config: treat `thought_level` as a compatibility alias for codex-acp `reasoning_effort` so `acpx codex set thought_level <value>` works on current codex-acp releases. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Session control/errors: surface actionable `set-mode` and `set` error messages when adapters reject unsupported session control params, and preserve wrapped adapter metadata in those failures. (#123) Thanks @manthan787 and @vincentkoc.
- Sessions/load fallback: suppress recoverable `session/load` error payloads during first-run prompt recovery and keep the session record rotated to the fresh ACP session. (#122) Thanks @lynnzc and @vincentkoc.
- Permissions/stats: track client permission denials in permission stats. (#120) Thanks @lynnzc.
- Agents/gemini: default to `--acp` for Gemini CLI and fall back to `--experimental-acp` for pre-0.33 releases. (#113)
- ACP/prompt blocks: preserve structured ACP prompt blocks instead of flattening them during prompt handling to support images and non-text. (#103) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Images/prompt validation: validate structured image prompt block MIME types and base64 payloads, emit human-readable CLI usage errors, and add an explicit non-CI live Cursor ACP smoke test path. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Windows/process spawning: detect PATH-resolved batch wrappers such as `npx` on Windows and enable shell mode only for those commands. (#90) Thanks @lynnzc.
